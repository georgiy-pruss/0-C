z      current time zone as &plusmn;H or &plusmn;HMM, e.g. -8 or +545 (Nepal); tz can be -12..+14
<span class=R>&plusmn;N</span>z    show current time in specified time zone (tz must follow format &plusmn;H or &plusmn;HMM)

<span class=R>N</span>c     convert &deg;Celsius to &deg;Farenheit, e.g. 100c --&gt; 212.0
<span class=R>N</span>f     convert &deg;Farenheit to &deg;Celsius, e.g. 98f --&gt; 36.7

s      start stopwatch (actually just remember the moment of start)
e      elapsed since start, also can show break time and work time
b      break (don't count the following period, start the break)
g      go on (continue working or whatever, end of break)

<span class=C>^</span>c     copy contents of display to clipboard (<span class=C>^</span> = Ctrl)
<span class=C>^</span>v     paste (append!) clipboard into display; the same as the right mouse button

<span class=C>^</span>s     toggle showing second hand (option 'seconds' in ini file)
<span class=C>^</span>t     toggle showing time in window caption bar aka title (option 'intitle')

c      show color dialog (just to have it easily accessible); on OK in the dialog,
       the choosen color is pasted back into display, on Cancel nothing happens
<span class=R>N</span>c     if display is #rrggbb, then that color is used to start the color dialog
k      put the current background color into display field as #rrggbb
<span class=R>N</span>k     use current display value #rrggbb for background (try k c OK k ;))

<span class=C>^</span>r<span class=C>^</span>g<span class=C>^</span>b change background color component up or down; change direction with <span class=C>^</span>i
<span class=C>^</span>i     invert direction of color component change

&larr;&rarr;&uarr;&darr;   move window left/right/up/down; hold Shift to move faster
<span class=C>^</span>&larr;&rarr;&uarr;&darr;  change size of the window; again, hold Shift to change more

i      info: show window position and size; note that Windows adds some values to real
       sizes, e.g. my Windows-10 adds 16,8 for resizable window, and 6,3 for
       "non-resizable"; you can set up your own correction data with this option in
       the ini file: corr=xr,yr,xnr,ynr (so, mine would be 16,8,6,3)

q      quit the program; btw it's the only way to exit W10clk screensaver

=      calculate expression (see below how to enter it)
enter  calculate expression too

<h2>Input</h2>
<pre>
0-9.   enter number, e.g. 42 or 3.14159265
+-     can be used for numbers with sign, e.g. +10 or -555555
:/     enter time and date, e.g. 3/11 or 2:00 or 2016/11/10.23:59:59 (notice dot)
ABCDEF hexadecimal digits (uppercase!) for hex. numbers in expression, put # in front
#      hexadecimal number indicator: #FF #DEADBEEF #100000000

       <e>binary and unary operations in math. expression (priority: ^, */%o, +-)</u>
+      +x  the same as x           x+y  sum
-      -x  negate                  x-y  subtract
*      *x  square, x*x             x*y  multiply

<b>CED</b>    Common Era Day number -- number of a day, counting since January 1st, 1 AD,
       that was day 1, then January 2nd was day 2 and so on, using the Julian calendar
       (years divisable by 4 are all leap), up till 1582/10/4 (CED 577737), when the
       counting scheme switched to the Gregorian calendar and day 1582/10/15 (CED 577738)
       followed. Such enumeration was chosen to eliminate negative numbers and to have
       somewhat natural scheme.
       1858/11/16 Tue CED 678577 = Julian Day Number (JDN) 2400000 (the difference is 1721423)

</pre>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Extract files w10clk.exe, w10clk.htm and w10clk.ini from
<a href="http://mas.orgfree.com/W10clk.zip">w10clk.zip</a> to some directory. For example, to
C:\Program Files\W10clock. Also w10clk needs cygwin-64 run-time library, cygwin1.dll. If
you don't have it in your computer, download that file too (from cygwin site or from
<a href="http://mas.orgfree.com/cygwin1_dll.zip">this archive</a>) and put it together with
other w10clk files. You can have several clock programs &mdash; in different directories or in
the same directory with different names. The matter is that the exe file looks for its ini
file using its name. So for example, you can have the main clock with the files named
w10clk.* and screensaver with names w10clkss.*. Create a shortcut to the main program (drag-and-drop
w10clk.exe to your desktop with the right button, choose 'create shortcut', move it to the
start menu if you wish). You can make it to start automatically when Windows starts, using
the registry or scheduler (more detail to follow). For setting up the screensaver, continue reading.
</p>
<h2>Screensaver</h2>
<p>
You can also set up the program as a screensaver. Copy the executable to some other file
with extension .scr, e.g. w10clkss.scr. Copy or create config file for it, it
must be named after the scr file, in our case &mdash; w10clkss.ini. For example:</p>
<pre>[window]
xywh=0,0,100,100    ; doesn't matter actually, it will be fullscreen anyway
bg=0,0,0            ; good choice
ticks=12,80,80,80   ; make ticks and hands thick
shand=6,80,80,80
mhand=12,80,80,80
hhand=24,80,80,80
lengths=8,84,84,58
resizable=no
ontop=yes</pre>
<p>
Then right-click on the scr file and choose Install. It will also start at once.
Press 'q' to stop it. It has no usual config dialog, like other screensavers, all
the setup is done in the ini file. Sorry for that, maybe some time I'll fix it...
Anyway, it'll serve as a screensaver. To exit it, press 'q', no other ways work.
Moreover, all of the clock functions work there in the screen saving mode &mdash;
date and time conversions, stopwatch, calculations, etc.
