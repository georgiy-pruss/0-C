CED    Common Era Day number -- number of a day since January 1st, 1 AD, i.e.
       that was day number 1, then January 2nd was day 2 and so on, using Julian
       calendar (year divisable by 4 are all leap), up till 1582/10/4 (CED 577737),
       when the counting scheme switches to Gregorian calendar and day 1582/10/15
       (CED 577738) follows. Such enumeration was chosen to eliminate negative
       numbers and to have somewhat natural scheme.
       CED 730122 = Julian Day Number 2451545 (the difference is 1721423)
