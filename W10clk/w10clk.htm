<b>CED</b>    Common Era Day number -- number of a day since January 1st, 1 AD, i.e.
       that was day number 1, then January 2nd was day 2 and so on, using Julian
       calendar (year divisable by 4 are all leap), up till 1582/10/4 (CED 577737),
       when the counting scheme switches to Gregorian calendar and day 1582/10/15
       (CED 577738) follows. Such enumeration was chosen to eliminate negative
       numbers and to have somewhat natural scheme.
       CED 730122 = Julian Day Number 2451545 (the difference is 1721423)

<h2>Screensaver</h2>
<p>
You can also set up it as a screensaver. Copy the executable to some other file
with extension .scr, e.g. w10clkss.scr. Copy or create config file for it, it
must be named then w10clkss.ini. Probably it should be not resizable, no time in
title, better black, etc. For example:</p>
<pre>[window]
xywh=10,10,1900,1060
bg=0,0,0
ticks=12,40,40,40
shand=7,40,40,40
mhand=11,44,42,44
hhand=22,44,42,44
intitle=yes
resizable=no
ontop=yes</pre>
<p>
Then right-click on the scr file and choose Install. It will also start at once.
Press 'q' to stop it. It has no usual config dialog, like other screensavers, all
the setup is done in ini file. Anyway, it'll serve as a screensaver. To exit it,
press 'q', no other way works. Moreover, it functions with all its features &mdash;
date/time, stopwatch, calculations, etc.
