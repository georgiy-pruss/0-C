W10clk -- Windows 10 got rid of the gadgets and it turned out I miss the clock so much! So this is my own program. When it all started, plain win32 api? Without Forms, AFT, MFC... [Petzold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Petzold)... 20 years ago? 30? It's fun now! :) Try the executable [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3wlka5resreryp/w10clk.exe?dl=0). See htm file for description.
