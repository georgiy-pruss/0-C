W10clk -- Windows 10 got rid of the gadgets and the most important and popular of them - the clock.
I can't stand that. So I had to write my own program. It was really fun. Going back to the roots.
When did it all start, plain win32 api? Without Forms, AFT, MFC... [Petzold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Petzold)... 20 years ago? 30? Yeah, it's like 25 years ago. But it's such fun now! :)

Now it includes:
* full color and size customization
* optional second hand
* optional time in caption (title) bar
* all possible time and date calculations: operations with dates/days, time/seconds
* unix time, 1970 up to 2106
* timezones
* stopwatch with breaks
* calculator (+ - * / modulo power exp log trigonomtry)
* decimal/hexadcimal numbers
* celsius/whatever akward temperature scale that starts at 32
* copy/paste with clipboard
* color choice dialog for your convenience
* screensaver

It will include:
* alarms
* reminders
* birthdays/anniversaries
* ufff maybe it's enough :)
