W10clk -- Windows 10 got rid of the windows gadgets, including the most important and popular of them -- the clock.
I can't stand that. So I had to write my own program. It was real fun. Going back to the roots.
When did it all start, plain win32 api? Without Forms, AFT, MFC... [Petzold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Petzold)... 20 years ago? 30? Yeah, it's like 25 years ago. But it's so much fun now! :)

Now the program includes:
* full color and size customization
* rectangular or circular clock face
* optional second hand
* optional time in caption (title) bar
* stopwatch with breaks
* time zones, current time in other time zones, customized names for time zones
* unix time conversions, years 1970 up to 2106
* all possible time and date calculations: operations with dates/days, time/seconds
* calculator (+ - * / modulo power roots exp log ln lb combinatorics trigonometry etc)
* decimal/hexadcimal numbers
* celsius/whatever awkward temperature scale that starts at 32
* copy/paste (append) with clipboard
* color choice dialog always easily available
* change background color with the dialog or with keys
* move window, resize window with arrows
* maximize/restore size with just one key
* show window size, use it as a simple 'tape measure' on screen
* option to chime every hour or half-hour
* option to say time aloud every hour or half-hour
* clock screensaver
* documentation on key F1 and [online](http://georgiy-pruss.github.io/w10clk.htm)

It may include:
* alarms
* reminders
* birthdays/anniversaries
* ufff maybe that's enough :)
